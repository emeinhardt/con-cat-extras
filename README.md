# `con-cat-extras`

Currently a scratchpad for working with the [constrained-categories](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/constrained-categories/) package.

Contains:

 - A minor variant of `Functor` from `Control.Functor.Constrained` without functional dependencies. 
 - Internal combinators (e.g. composition, S, K, dup) for Cartesian closed categories.
